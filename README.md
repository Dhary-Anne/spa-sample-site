# spa-sample-site

General Info

In this self-learning project, I used webpack to bundle different modules and created each of the elements on the pages with only the DOM. Coding this project was not difficult at all but ensuring that webpack was configured properly was definitely a challenge. The website features three pages, a home page, services page, and a contact page. Each page has a tab that has specified CSS styling for when each tab is active. My favorite part of this project was using CSS Grid to create the services page. I learned and honed my skills with CSS, the DOM, modules, and functional programming.
