# spa-sample-site

General Info

In this self-learning project, I used webpack to bundle different modules and creates each of the elements on the pages with only the DOM. Coding this project was not difficult at all but ensuring that webpack was configures properly was definitely a challenge. The wepage features three pages, a home page, services page, and a contact page. Each page has a tab that has specified CSS styling when each tab is clicked. My favorite part of this project was using CSS Grid to create the services page. I learned and honed my skills with CSS, the DOM, modules, and functional programming.
